This project is an ongoing full-stack learning project and also my first complete experience building a full-stack web application, especially working deeply on the backend side.

Although this was an internal project, I faced multiple real-world challenges while implementing authentication, database integration, API design, environment variables, and deployment. Through this process, I learned a lot about backend development, MongoDB, JWT authentication, API testing, and production deployment on Vercel.

Due to discovering the job opportunity a bit late, I had around 2 days to:

Learn and implement backend concepts

Build APIs

Integrate the frontend with the backend

Test APIs using Postman

Deploy the application successfully

The current UI is basic and entry-level, as my primary focus during this phase was understanding backend architecture and full-stack workflow. I am actively working on improving the UI to make it cleaner, more interactive, and user-friendly, and I plan to push UI updates within the next 1–2 days.

This project reflects my curiosity, learning mindset, and willingness to step outside my comfort zone to explore new technologies and concepts.
